No.\\n\\nThere is no function overloading in Python\\n\\nUnlike C++, a Python function is specified by its name alone The number, order, names, or types of arguments cannot be used to distinguish between two functions with the same name\\n\\nTwo different functions can’t have the same name, even if they have different arguments\\n\\nBut: see operator overloading in later slides (Note: van Rossum playing with function overloading for the future)\\n\\nDefault Values for Arguments\\n\\nYou can provide default values for a function’s arguments\\n\\nThese arguments are optional when the function is called\\n\\n>>> def myfun(b, c=3, d=“hello”):\\n\\nreturn b + c >>> myfun(5,3,”hello”) >>> myfun(5,3) >>> myfun(5)\\n\\nAll of the above function calls return 8\\n\\nKeyword Arguments\\n\\nCan call a function with some/all of its arguments out of order as long as you specify their names >>> def foo(x,y,z): return(2*x,4*y,8*z) >>> foo(2,3,4) (4, 12, 32) >>> foo(z=4, y=2, x=3) (6, 8, 32) >>> foo(-2, z=-4, y=-3) (-4, -12, -32)\\n\\nCan be combined with defaults, too\\n\\n>>> def foo(x=1,y=2,z=3): return(2*x,4*y,8*z) >>> foo() (2, 8, 24) >>> foo(z=100) (2, 8, 800)\\n\\nFunctions are first-class objects\\n\\nFunctions can be used as any other\\n\\ndatatype, eg: •\\u202fArguments to function •\\u202fReturn values of functions •\\u202fAssigned to variables •\\u202fParts of tuples, lists, etc\\n\\n>>> def square(x): return x*x\\n\\n>>> def applier(q, x): return q(x)\\n\\n>>> applier(square, 7) 49\\n\\nLambda Notation\\n\\nPython’s lambda creates anonymous functions >>> applier(lambda z: z * 42, 7) 14 •\\u202fNote: only one expression in the lambda\\n\\nbody;
